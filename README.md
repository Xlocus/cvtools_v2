# some c/c++ or cuda operations for computer vision
This depository contains some operations (e.g. deformable convolution, roi align and etc.) coded by c/c++ or cuda for faster and is copied or modified from https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection.

My purpose is to deploy them for my own experiments independently.

requirements:
python >=3.7
torch >= 1.5

install:
